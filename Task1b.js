 * while also allowing us to add any todos that we want?
 *
 * Replace the "__" in each of the "__todo" function definitions to create more logical 
 * function names and define some logic to accomplish these tasks inspired by 
 * what you did in Part A. Call both function in mainTask1b().
 * 
 * In addition to updating function names, only modify the file under
